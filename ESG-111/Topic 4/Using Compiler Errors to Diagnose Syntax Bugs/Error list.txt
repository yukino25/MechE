void setup(9600) {

    Compilation error: variable or field 'setup' declared void

    With functions requiring a value as input, the variable name is used in parenthesis not the value itself, void setup is not expecting or using the value regardless. 



pinMode(4,INPUT_PULL_DOWN);


    Compilation error: 'INPUT_PULL_DOWN' was not declared in this scope

    INPUT_PULL_DOWN is not a defined function/variable. arduinos don't have internal pulldown resistors, they have pull up resistors or require external pulldown resistors


PinMode(5, INPUT_PULL_DOWN);

    Compilation error: 'INPUT_PULL_DOWN' was not declared in this scope
    Compilation error: 'PinMode' was not declared in this scope

    Same issue as before, additionally PinMode is improperly capitalized, "P" is uppercase rather than lowercase



attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(4), strstp, RISING);

    Compilation error: 'strstp' was not declared in this scope

 Brackets were missing at the end of void startup(), extending functions beyond intended scope, not allowing void strstp to be declared 




attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(5), lap, RISING);

    Compilation error: 'lap' was not declared in this scope

 Brackets were missing at the end of void startup(), extending functions beyond intended scope, not allowing void lap to be declared 


digitalWrite(13, Low);

    error: 'Low' was not declared in this scope

    'Low' should be all capitalized 'LOW'



start_time = Millis();

    'Millis' was not declared in this scope

    'Millis' is incorrectly capitalized it should be 'millis'


digitalWrite(13, high);

    'high' was not declared in this scope

    'high' should be all capitalized 'HIGH'


if ((cur - start_time) < 100)

    'cur' was not declared in this scope

    'cur' is misspelled it should be 'curr'



serial.print("Lap: ");

    'serial' was not declared in this scope

    'serial' is incorrectly capitalized it should be 'Serial'


DigitalWrite(13, LOW);

    'DigitalWrite' was not declared in this scope

    'DigitalWrite' is incorrectly capitalized it should be 'digitalWrite'



stat_time = 0;

    'stat_time' was not declared in this scope

    'stat_time' is misspelled it should be 'start_time'



int curr = mills();

    'mills' was not declared in this scope

    'mills' is misspelled it should be 'millis'


retrun;

    'retrun' was not declared in this scope

    'retrun' is misspelled it should be 'return'


Serial.println("s");

    expected ';' before 'Serial'

    The previous line 'Serial.print(((double)(curr - lap_time))/1000)' did not end with a ;


undefined reference to `loop'

    There is no void loop() function which is required for the arduino ide language
