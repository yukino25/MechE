 int timer = 3000;  //sets timer to 30sec
    time is measured in milliseconds, this results in only 3 Seconds
    change to:  int timer = 30000;


  int num_pixels = 7; //the number of NeoPixels on the Circuit Playground Express
    this only uses 7 of the 10 leds on the board
    changed to   int num_pixels = 10; 


  int red=125;
  int green=50;
  int blue=55;
    expected RGB is (68,0,153) red should be 68,green should be 0,blue should be 153
    Change to 
    int red=68;
    int green=0;
    int blue=153;

   if(digitalRead(5)) //button D4 starts the timer
    this reads from pin 5 instead of pin 4
    Changed to    if(digitalRead(4))


    for(j=1; j < j; j++)  //turns on all NeoPixels up to current counter
        This compares the value of j to j which breaks the loop. leds begin at 0, this skips one led
        changed to   for(j=0; j <= i; j++)

    CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(j,green,red,blue); //illuminates in purple 
        The order of color values are incorrect it is reading green in reds place, red in greens place
        changed to CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(j,red,green,blue);


    tone(A0, 3990, 200);  //plays a pleasant 399Hz sound for 200ms to signal end of timer. 
        the frequency is read as 3390Hz
        changed to   tone(A0, 399, 200); 

    CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(j, blue, green, red); 
        The order of color values are incorrect
        changed to CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(j,red,green,blue);

    tone(A0, 399, 200); //plays a pleasant 399Hz sound for 200ms to signal end of timer.
        currently this plays every 3 seconds rather than at the end of the timer
        moved to after the for(i=9;i>1;i--) loop


    delay(count_time);  //per fade step delay
        the delay was before the leds were set on, currently the leds would be set on then emedietly turned off
        it was moved to right before clearPixels()

    for(i=9; i>1; i--) //turns on off NeoPixels one by one
        ends before the first leds can turn off
        changed to for(i=9; i>=0; i--);
